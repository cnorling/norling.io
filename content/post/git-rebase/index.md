I briefly touched on git rebases in [this post about editing commit messages]({{< ref "edit-commit-messages" >}}), but it's worth diving deeper into git rebases and how you can use them to rewrite history in git. It's a very useful skill to have in your toolbelt, and it helps a lot when doing things like resolving merge conflicts.
